# tokex-convert-py
A toki pona to tokex converter.

Currently only takes input once run (no stdin), and only outputs in text, to stdout. Also, it doesn't implement Abigail's EOF marker or full stop conversion as of yet.

Coded in good faith that all input will be valid toki pona and nothing else. Therefore, all wrong output is due to wrong input (garbage in, garbage out), and the _user's_ problem (also see license).
